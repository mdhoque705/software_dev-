        <p>The forward defense is a key batting technique in cricket used to block deliveries and protect the wicket. It is usually played against a good-length ball aimed at or near the stumps. To play it, the batter must watch the ball closely from the bowlerâ€™s hand and take a small step forward with the front foot. The front knee should bend slightly, bringing the head and body over the ball for better balance and control. The bat should come down straight and close to the front pad, with soft hands and a relaxed grip to ensure the ball drops safely to the ground. The goal is not to score but to defend the wicket by deadening the ball. Keeping the bat and pad close together also helps avoid LBW. Practicing the forward defense improves technique, footwork, and judgment, making it essential for building innings and surviving tough spells from bowlers.</p>

            <p>
                The pull shot is an aggressive cricket stroke played to short-pitched deliveries that rise to chest or shoulder height. It is mainly played on the leg side, between mid-wicket and square leg. To play the pull shot effectively, the batter must first judge the length early and quickly shift their weight onto the back foot. As the ball approaches, the body should rotate slightly, and the front shoulder should open up to allow a free swing of the bat. The bat is swung horizontally across the body, keeping the eyes firmly on the ball. A strong top hand ensures better control, and rolling the wrists at contact helps keep the ball down, reducing the chance of getting caught. The pull shot requires good timing, balance, and confidence. When played correctly, it can be a powerful run-scoring option against fast bowlers. Regular practice helps improve both safety and precision while playing the shot.

        <button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#cover"  aria-controls="#cover"><h2 class="h5">How To Play Cover Drive</h2></button>
        <div class="accordion-collapse collapse" id="cover">
        <div class="accordion-body bg-light">
            <p>The cover drive is one of the most elegant and classic shots in cricket, usually played to a full-length delivery outside off stump. It is a front-foot shot that sends the ball through the cover region. To play a proper cover drive, the batter must watch the ball closely and step forward with the front foot toward the pitch of the ball. The head and body should be aligned over the front knee for balance and control. With a smooth, flowing swing of the bat, the ball is driven along the ground with a slightly open face, directing it between extra cover and mid-off. Timing and placement are more important than power. The top hand should remain dominant to keep the ball on the ground, while the bottom hand guides direction. Practicing the cover drive improves footwork, balance, and shot selection, making it a valuable tool for scoring runs stylishly and safely.</p>
