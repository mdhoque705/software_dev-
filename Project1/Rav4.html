    <div class="d-flex justify-content-center mt-5"><img src="images/Rav4post.svg" alt="Review of Toyota Rav4"></div>
    
    <article class="text-light mt-5 ms-5 me-5">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The Toyota RAV4 has been one of the most successful SUVs globally, and the 2025 edition continues to build on its legacy with refined styling, smart hybrid technology, and improved features that appeal to both urban and adventurous drivers. As compact SUVs become the go-to vehicle for many, the RAV4 2025 sets itself apart by offering a reliable, stylish, and eco-conscious driving experience.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Redesigned Yet Familiar Exterior</h2>
        <p>From the outside, the Toyota RAV4 2025 retains its rugged SUV stance but introduces a sleeker, more modern front fascia. The grille has been reworked with a sharper outline, new headlamp designs now feature sleeker DRLs, and the rear tailgate incorporates subtle styling tweaks for a cleaner finish. The alloy wheels, available in multiple designs across trims, complement the overall athletic posture of the vehicle.

            For drivers who love a little adventure, the RAV4 TRD Off-Road variant comes with bolder cladding, higher ground clearance, and specially tuned suspension, making it ideal for light trail duties while still maintaining on-road comfort.</p>
        <br>
        <h2> Powertrain and Performance</h2>
        <p>Toyota continues to focus heavily on efficiency, and that’s clearly visible in the 2025 RAV4 lineup. The standard gasoline engine is a 2.5-liter inline-4 that delivers a solid balance of power and fuel economy. It produces around 203 horsepower, which is sufficient for daily driving, commuting, and even highway cruising.

            However, the real highlight is the RAV4 Hybrid and RAV4 Prime (Plug-in Hybrid) models. The hybrid delivers impressive mileage figures — estimated to be 41 MPG in the city and 38 MPG on the highway, while the Prime model adds a fully electric driving range of over 40 miles.
            
            Both hybrid models utilize Toyota’s e-AWD system, giving the RAV4 confident grip and handling even in slippery or uneven road conditions. The RAV4 2025 doesn’t aim to be a sports SUV, but it does offer smooth acceleration, responsive steering, and a composed ride.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Interior: Comfort, Tech, and Space</h2>
        <p>Inside the cabin, the RAV4 2025 feels well-built and thoughtfully designed. The use of soft-touch materials, improved dashboard layout, and available two-tone interiors enhance the sense of sophistication.

            There’s ample legroom and headroom for both front and rear passengers, making it a practical choice for families. The rear seats split-fold flat to open up to nearly 70 cubic feet of cargo space, which is generous for the segment.
            
            Toyota has also updated the infotainment system, offering a 12.3-inch touchscreen on higher trims with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The interface is faster and more intuitive than previous models, and the inclusion of physical buttons for climate control and volume remains a user-friendly touch.
            
            <strong>Optional features include:</strong>

            <ul class="fw-bold fst-italic">
           <li> Heated and ventilated front seats</li>
            
           <li>Panoramic sunroof</li>
            
           <li>JBL premium audio system</li>
            
           <li>Power liftgate</li>
           </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Safety and Driver Assistance</h2>
        <p>Safety continues to be a top priority for Toyota, and the RAV4 2025 is no exception. It comes standard with Toyota Safety Sense 3.0, <strong>which includes:</strong>

        <ul class="fw-bold fst-italic ">
            <li>Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection</li>

            <li>Full-Speed Range Dynamic Radar Cruise Control</li>
            
            <li>Road Sign Assist</li>
            
            <li>Automatic High Beams</li>
            
            <li>The SUV has already scored high in crash tests and is expected to earn top ratings from the IIHS and NHTSA.</li>
            
            <li>Blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, and a 360-degree camera system are available in higher trims, making parking and highway driving easier and safer.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Tech and Connectivity</h2>
        <p>Tech-savvy drivers will appreciate Toyota’s efforts to modernize the RAV4 experience. Apart from the upgraded infotainment system, <strong>the SUV offers:</strong>
        <ul class="fw-bold fst-italic">
            <li>Over-the-air (OTA) updates</li>
            
            <li>Built-in voice assistant</li>
            
            <li>Wireless smartphone charging</li>
            
            <li>Connected services for remote lock/unlock, vehicle tracking, and climate control via the Toyota app</li>
            
            <li>Additionally, the digital instrument cluster and head-up display (HUD) in upper trims give the cabin a futuristic, cockpit-like vibe.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Pricing and Trims</h2>
        <p>The 2025 RAV4 comes in multiple trims: LE, XLE, XLE Premium, Adventure, Limited, Hybrid XLE, Hybrid Limited, and Prime. Prices start around $29,000 for the base LE and go up to nearly $44,000 for the fully-loaded RAV4 Prime.

            Toyota has balanced affordability and features quite well — even the base trims are generously equipped with advanced safety and infotainment options.</p>
        <br>
        <h2> Environmental Impact</h2>
        <p>Toyota continues to push toward electrification, and the RAV4 Hybrid and Prime are a big part of that mission. These versions allow drivers to significantly reduce fuel consumption and emissions without compromising practicality. The 2025 models also use more eco-conscious materials in the cabin and optimize engine start/stop systems for urban efficiency.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Final Verdict: Should You Buy the RAV4 2025?</h2>
